## Future Vision

FlowBuddy will become an All-In-One solution that eliminates the need for juggling between different websites/apps/files. Anything you need will be at your fingertips ready to use.

We are planning on adding template support. With many plugins to chose from, there will be endless options for anyone to setup their working environment exactly how they want.

It will be template based so that people can share their configurations with others. 
This will help people discover new tools easier.


Although there are hundreds of apps that can do specific features of FlowBuddy better, our approach is unique.

We believe that simpicity is at the core of productivity.

3. **Shortcut Templates**
   - Create a textbox in FlowBuddy that will quickly search anything we type.
4. **Work Clock**
   - Set up work cycles (Example: 2 hours of work, 15 minutes of break) Keep track of time working on a specific task.
5. **Easy Reminder Tool**
6. **Folder Mirror**

   - Set up a project folder Mirror and add smart project restructuring to make sure every project is organized the exact same way
